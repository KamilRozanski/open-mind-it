            <p class="technology__description">
                Simply put, the work of most organizations would slow to a crawl without functioning IT systems. You’d
                be hard-pressed to find a business that doesn’t at least partially rely on computers and the networks
                that connect them. Maintaining a standard level of service, security and connectivity is a huge task,
                but it’s not the only priority or potential challenge on their plates.<br><br>

                More and more companies want to implement more intuitive and sophisticated solutions. “IT can provide
                the edge a company needs to outsmart, outpace and out-deliver competitors,” says Edward Kiledjian, a
                Chief Information Security Officer and technology blogger. Let’s take a look at the needs that current
                and future IT specialists will be working on:<br><br>

                Data overload: Businesses need to process huge amounts of data. This requires large amounts of
                processing power, sophisticated software and human analytical skills.<br><br>
                Mobile and wireless usages: More employers are offering remote work options that require smartphones,
                tablets and laptops with wireless hotspots and roaming ability.
                Cloud services: Most businesses no longer operate their own “server farms” to store massive amounts of
                data. Many businesses now work with cloud services—third-party hosting platforms that maintain that
                data.<br><br>
                Bandwidth for video hosting: Videoconferencing solutions have become more and more popular, so more
                network bandwidth is needed to support them sufficiently.
